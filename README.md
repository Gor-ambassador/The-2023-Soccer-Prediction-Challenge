Hello, we are team Friends Of 3-1-0!

Our repository is made specially for **The 2023 Soccer Prediction Challenge**, organized as part of the special issue "Machine Learning in Soccer" of the _Machine Learning_ journal.

It contains C# project (see 'Testing' directory) with 'SoccerPrediction.sln', 'Report.xlsx' as the output from this project. Additionally, a 'StatsReport.xlsx' has been created (the difference lies in the fullness of 'Statistics' page).
