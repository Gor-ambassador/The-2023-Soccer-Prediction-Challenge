Hello, we are team Friends Of 3-1-0!

Our repository is made specially for [The 2023 Soccer Prediction Challenge](https://sites.google.com/view/2023soccerpredictionchallenge/home)**, organized as part of the **special issue "Machine Learning in Soccer" of the _Machine Learning_ journal**.

It contains C# project (see '_Testing_' directory) with '_SoccerPrediction.sln_', '_Report.xlsx_' as the output from this project. Additionally, a '_StatsReport.xlsx_' has been created (the difference lies in the fullness of '_Statistics_' page).
